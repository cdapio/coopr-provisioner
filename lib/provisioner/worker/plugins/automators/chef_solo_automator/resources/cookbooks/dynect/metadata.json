{"name":"dynect","version":"1.0.11","description":"LWRP for managing DNS records with Dynect's REST API","long_description":"# dynect Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/dynect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/dynect) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/dynect.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/dynect)\n\nAutomatically configures system DNS using Dyn's API.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- All platforms supported by Chef\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 11+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\nA Dynect account.\n\nThe `dynect_rest` gem. The `dynect::default` recipe installs this gem from <http://rubygems.org>\n\n## Attributes\n\nThe following attributes need to be set for the cookbookt to function. `Note`: These are rather sensitive attributes so it's advised that you store these in a secure location such as an encrypted databag and set them via a wrapper cookbook.\n\n- `node['dynect']['customer']` - Customer ID\n- `node['dynect']['username']` - Username\n- `node['dynect']['password']` - Password\n- `node['dynect']['zone']`- Zone\n- `node['dynect']['domain']` - Domain\n\nEC2 specific attributes:\n\n- `node['dynect']['ec2']['type']` - type of system, web, db, etc. Default is 'ec2'.\n- `node['dynect']['ec2']['env']` - logical application environment the system is in. Default is 'prod'.\n\n## Custom Resources\n\n### rr\n\nDNS Resource Record.\n\nActions:\n\nApplies to the DNS record being managed.\n\n- `:create`\n- `:replace`\n- `:update`\n- `:delete`\n\nAttribute Parameters:\n\n- `record_type` - DNS record type (CNAME, A, etc)\n- `rdata` - record data, see the Dyn API documentation.\n- `ttl` - time to live in seconds\n- `fqdn` - fully qualified domain name\n- `username` - dyn username\n- `password` - dyn password\n- `customer` - dyn customer id\n- `zone` - DNS zone\n\nNone of the parameters have default values.\n\nExample:\n\n```ruby\ndynect_rr \"webprod\" do\n    record_type \"A\"\n    rdata({\"address\" => \"10.1.1.10\"})\n    fqdn \"webprod.#{node['dynect']['domain']}\"\n    customer node['dynect']['customer']\n    username node['dynect']['username']\n    password node['dynect']['password']\n    zone     node['dynect']['zone']\nend\n```\n\n## Recipes\n\nThis cookbook provides the following recipes.\n\n### default\n\nThe default recipe installs Adam Jacob's `dynect_rest` gem during the Chef run's compile time to ensure it is available in the same run as utilizing the `dynect_rr` resource/provider.\n\n### ec2\n\n**Only use this recipe on Amazon AWS EC2 hosts!**\n\nThe `dynect::ec2` recipe provides an example of working with the Dyn API with EC2 instances. It creates CNAME records based on the EC2 instance ID (`node['ec2']['instance_id']`), and a constructed hostname from the dynect.ec2 attributes.\n\nThe recipe also edits `/etc/resolv.conf` to search `compute-1.internal` and the dynect.domain and use dynect.domain as the default domain, and it will set the nodes hostname per the DNS settings.\n\n### a_record\n\nThe `dynect::a_record` recipe will create an `A` record for the node using the detected hostname and IP address from `ohai`.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nInformation on the Dynect API:\n\n- [PDF](http://cdn.dyndns.com/pdf/Dynect-API.pdf)\n\nDynect REST Ruby Library:\n\n- [Gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/dynect_rest)\n- [Code](http://github.com/adamhjk/dynect_rest)\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2008-2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"dynect":"Installs the dynect_rest RubyGem","dynect::ec2":"Dynamically configures Dyn resource records for EC2 nodes based on instance ID and prepopulated attributes on the node","dynect::a_record":"Example resource usage to configure an A record"}}
