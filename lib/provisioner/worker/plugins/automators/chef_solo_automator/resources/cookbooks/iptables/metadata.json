{"name":"iptables","version":"2.2.0","description":"Installs the iptables daemon and provides a LWRP for managing rules","long_description":"# iptables Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/iptables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/iptables) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/iptables.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/iptables)\n\nInstalls iptables and provides a custom resource for adding and removing iptables rules\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- Ubuntu/Debian\n- RHEL/CentOS and derivatives\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 12.5+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- none\n\n## Recipes\n### default\nThe default recipe will install iptables and provides a ruby script (installed in `/usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables`) to manage rebuilding firewall rules from files dropped off in `/etc/iptables.d`.\n\n### disabled\nThe disabled recipe will install iptables, disable the `iptables` service (on RHEL platforms), and delete the rules directory `/etc/iptables.d`.\n\n## Attributes\n `default['iptables']['iptables_sysconfig']` and `default['iptables']['iptables_sysconfig']` are hashes that are used to template /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config and /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables-config. The keys must be upper case and any key / value pair included will be added to the config file.\n\n## Custom Resource\n### rule\nThe custom resource drops off a template in `/etc/iptables.d` after the `name` parameter. The rule will get added to the local system firewall through notifying the `rebuild-iptables` script. See **Examples** below.\n\nNOTE: In the 1.0 release of this cookbook the iptables_rule definition was converted to a custom resource.  This changes the behavior of disabling iptables rules. Previously a rule could be disabled by specifying `enable false`. You must now specify `action :disable`\n\n## Usage\nAdd `recipe[iptables]` to your runlist to ensure iptables is installed / running and to ensure that the `rebuild-iptables` script is on the system. Then create use iptables_rule to add individual rules. See **Examples**.\n\nSince certain chains can be used with multiple tables (e.g., _PREROUTING_), you might have to include the name of the table explicitly (i.e., _*nat_, _*mangle_, etc.), so that the `/usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables` script can infer how to assemble final ruleset file that is going to be loaded. Please note, that unless specified otherwise, rules will be added under the **filter** table by default.\n\n### Examples\nTo enable port 80, e.g. in an `my_httpd` cookbook, create the following template:\n\n```text\n# Port 80 for http\n-A FWR -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n```\n\nThis template would be located at: `my_httpd/templates/default/http.erb`. Then within your recipe call:\n\n```ruby\niptables_rule 'http' do\n  action :enable\nend\n```\n\nTo redirect port 80 to local port 8080, e.g., in the aforementioned `my_httpd` cookbook, create the following template:\n\n```text\n*nat\n# Redirect anything on eth0 coming to port 80 to local port 8080\n-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080\n```\n\nPlease note, that we explicitly add name of the table (being _*nat_ in this example above) where the rules should be added.\n\nThis would most likely go in the cookbook, `my_httpd/templates/default/http_8080.erb`. Then to use it in `recipe[httpd]`:\n\n```ruby\niptables_rule 'http_8080' do\n  action :enable\nend\n```\n\n## Chefspec Matchers\n- enable_iptables_rule(resource_name)\n- disable_iptables_rule(resource_name)\n\n## License & Authors\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2008-2015, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"default":"Installs iptables and sets up .d style config directory of iptables rules","disabled":"Disables iptables"}}
